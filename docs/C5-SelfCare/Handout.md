# Wants and Needs (Self Care)

## What are they?

*From **Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J. Keith Miller*

* Needs are defined as the basic needs that are required to survive
    * All people have dependency needs
    * Adults are responsible for knowing how to address each need
    * Some needs like phsical nurturing or emotional nurturing can only be met through interaction with another person
* Wants are the preferences, items or goals we look to include in our life
    * Some wants are large and shape many life choices and direction 
      * "I want to be married to this person"
      * "I want to have a child"
      * "I want to be a doctor"
    * Some wants are small and make up a few choices and express our preference
      * "I want Mexican food tonight"
      * "I want to sit down"
* Wants and needs become apparent as we bring our Reality and Boundaries into Relationships

## What is the issue?

* Codependents have difficulty meetings their own wants and needs
* This can become evident in some different ways
  * Too Dependent
    * I am aware of my needs and wants, but I expect other people to take care of them for me.
  * Anti Dependent
    * I am aware of my needs and wants, but I am unwilling to accept help meeting them from anyone else.
  * Wantless and Needless
    * I am not aware of my needs and wants
    * I get my wants and needs confused

## What does it look like?

* Sharing our Reality and Boundaries in a relationship allows us to connect with the other person, which is a innate need we all have
* There are three ways that sharing of our Reality and Boundaries can look
  * Inter-Dependent
<br><br><br><br>
    * Two overlapping circles
      * Each circle has portions that are seperate
      * Each circle has portions that are overlapping
    * Allows both people to have their own sense of self (Reality)
    * Allows both people to understand they are seperate from the other (Boundaries)
    * Allows both people to share their choosen wants and needs with another (Connection)

  * Anti-Dependent
<br><br><br><br>
    * Two seperate circles
      * Each circle is completely seperate
    * Allows both people to have their own sense of self (Reality)
    * Allows both people to understand they are seperate from the other (Boundaries)
    * Does not allow both people to share their choosen wants and needs with another (Connection)

  * Enmeshed
<br><br><br><br>
    * One oval
      * There is no clear definition of where one circle stops and another begins
    * Does not allow both people to have their own sense of self (Reality)
    * Does not allow both people to understand they are seperate from the other (Boundaries)
    * Does not allow both people to share their choosen wants and needs with another (Connection)
