# Difficulty acknowledging and meeting our own needs and wants
#### From _Facing Codependence_ by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, & J. Keith Miller

Each of us has basic needs and individual wants that are our responsibility to satisfy.
Needs are the things we must have to survive. All people have dependency needs, children as
well as adults. The difference between a child's dependency needs and those of an adult is that
the child must have his or her needs met initially by his or her major caregiver and be taught how
to take care of each one in the course of growing up. An adult is responsible for knowing how to
address each need and asking for help when help is truly needed.

**The dependency needs for adults are food, shelter, clothing, medical/dental
attention, physical nurturing, emotional nurturing (time, attention, and direction from
others), sex, and financial resources (earning, saving, spending, budgeting and investing
money).**

**There are some needs that can only be met through interaction with another person,
such as physical nurturing or emotional nurturing**. But we must be taught that it is our
responsibility to recognize those needs and ask someone appropriate to meet them. We in turn
must learn to meet others' needs at appropriate times in proper circumstances, which is called
interdependence.

**Wants can be divided into two categories: little wants and big wants. Little wants
are truly preferences. They are things we don't have to have, but when we choose them
they bring us great joy. The big wants take our lives in a general direction and bring us
fulfillment. They include such things as "I want to be married to this person." " I want to
be a doctor." "I want to develop this corporation." "I want to have a child."**

### The four categories of difficulty acknowledging and meeting our wants and needs:
We experience not being in touch with our needs and wants in one of
four different ways according to the experiences we had in childhood.

1. I am **too dependent**. I know my needs or wants but expect other people to take care of them for
   me, and I wait, expecting them to know to do so as I do not take care of them myself.
2. I am **anti dependent**. I am able to acknowledge to myself that I have needs and wants, but I try
   to meet them myself and am unable to accept help or guidance from anyone else. I'd
   rather go without the thing needed or wanted than be vulnerable and ask for help.
3. I am **needless and wantless**. Although I have needs or wants, I am not aware of them.
4. I **get my wants and needs confused**. I know what I want and I get it, but I don't know what I
   need. For example, I try to take care of my needs that I am unaware of by buying
   everything I want. Though I may need physical nurturing, I buy some new clothes
   instead.

Not tending to one's needs and wants appropriately is often connected to a feeling of low
self-esteem (shame). Whenever the "adult child" feels needy or has a want shame flares at the
onset of the experience of needing or wanting. This shame originally came from childhood
experiences, when expressing a need or want was met with abuse by a caregiver - even though
that memory of abuse has long been "forgotten," is no longer conscious. The adult codependent
feels as if he or she is terribly selfish to need or want something, however legitimate it may be.
