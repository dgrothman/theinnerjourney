# Boundary Statements
## External Boundary (My Body)
### Physical Boundary
* I have a right to control distance and touch with you, and you have a right to control distance and touch with me.
### Sexual Boundary
* I have a right to control if, when, where, and how I am sexual with another person, and you have the same right.
## Internal Boundary (Thoughts, Feelings, Behavior)
* I am responsible for what I think, what I feel, and what I choose to do or not do. You are responsible for what you
think, feel, and do or don't do.
* If I am in a relationship with you, I am responsible for noting the impact of my thoughts, feelings, and behavior on you.
I then can decide if I will adjust to make our relationship more comfortable.
( This statement does not hold in a victim-offender situation. If I am authentically offended, my reaction
is not about me and my history, it is about your abuse )
