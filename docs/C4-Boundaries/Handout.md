# Boundaries

<br><br>

## What are they?

* Symbolic "fences" that protect our value
    * Keep others from coming into our space
    * Keep us from going into another's space
* Contain our reality (thoughts, feelings, choices, limits, behaviors) - our sense of who we are

<br><br>

## Two components

#### External
External boundaries keep our physical body separate
  * Allows us to choose the distance we want between ourselves and others and whether or not we allow someone to touch us
  * This also includes sexual boundaries for distance and touch
#### Internal
Internal boundaries protect our reality (thoughts, feelings, choices, limits, behaviors)
  * Take responsibility for our reality versus blaming others
  * Releasing the responsibility of the reality of others
      * Refrain from negative control, projection, and manipulation

<br><br>

## Myths about boundaries

* I am being selfish or disobedient (feelings of guilt or shame)
* I will hurt others or be hurt by others
* They are permanent

<br>

## Boundary violations

* Resentment: always is a boundary issue
#### External
* Getting into a person's space or personal belongings (unwanted touch, going through personal drawers/closet, checking a phone or purse/wallet)
* Listening to a conversation without permission
#### Internal
* Yelling, name calling, ridiculing
* Shaming or patronizing (devaluing of any form)
* Negative Control: telling someone how they should feel, think, or act

<br>

## Boundaries are personal

Each person's boundaries will look different from others
  * What hurts? (how do you stop the pain?)
  * What feels good? (pursuing joy)
  * What is mine? (knowing your reality)
  * What am I willing to lose or give up?

<br>

## Barriers to boundaries

* Our Belief System (history and distored thinking)
* Enabling: destructive form of helping
    * We attach ourselves to another's need for us
    * This builds resentment and we feel used or sorry for ourselves
* Enmeshed: overly involved in another
    * Excessively worry about another's problems
    * Become dependent on those around us which causes us to detach from ourselves

## When we don't have boundaries

* We have defense mechanisms
    * Avoidance
    * Procrastination
    * Self-sabotage
    * Drama

<br>

## Setting boundaries

* Realization of our own person apart from others (knowing our reality)
* Separation of identity: allows for "I" "me" and "self"
    * Gain self-awareness
    * Define your reality
* Saying "no"
    * Set limits
    * Practice self-control
    * Create goals and pursue with continued patience
* Putting boundaries into words
    * I would like to revisit this later when the energy has dissipated
    * I hear that you think I am  [insert negative stuff]. I would like to think about this because I'm not sure what to do with it

<br>

## Boundaries and relationships

* We are **RESPONSIBLE** for knowing the impact of our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors on another
    * Be sensitive but do not control
* When impacted or pressured by others, it is our responsibility to manage our reactions
    * Let go of the expectation
    * Communicate
* We **DECIDE** to adjust or relinquish something
    * We do not mindlessly lose our reality to another
* Openness (being vulnerable) and having boundaries leads to connection and intimacy

## Boundary Sketches  
#### Healthy boundaries  
Healthy boundaries are like a house with a door with a doorknob on the inside only seperating us from others
* We choose when to open the door and let someone in
  * Allows for connection
* We choose when to leave the door closed
  * Protects ourself from others
  * Protects others from ourself  
#### No boundaries  
No boundaries are like having nothing seperating us from others
  * We do not know when we are being aboused or abusing others
  * Defficult to say "no"
  * Can be easily taken advantage of  
#### Partial boundaries  
Partial boundaries are like having gaps in your "wall" that seperates us from others
  * At certain times and/or with certain people can set limits and protect oneself
  * At other times and/or with other people may abuse or be abused  
#### Walls  
Wall are like having a brick wall with no door isolating us from others
  * Give solid protection but do not allow for connection at any level causing more isolation
  * People may move from one kind of wall to another
  * Anger - message of an erupting volcano
  * Fear - retreat from others to keep safe
  * Silence - emotions are turned off; "the silent treatment"
  * Words - talks over people; oblivious to contribution of others
