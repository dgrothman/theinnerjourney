Boundaries Class 4 Notes

Internal Boundary - I create what I think and feel and am in control of what I do and don't do. - I am responsible for how I create myself.

Taking responsibility in the relationship:
I NEED TO NOTE THE IMPACT I HAVE ON OTHERS AND THEY NEED TO NOTE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON ME.
-Noting the impact means active listening and thinking about the impact we have on others. If we do not use the boundary by listening and noting the impact the boundary will become a wall.

Assigning meaning based on incoming information - We want to blame people for the emotional response we get from how we are assigning meaning to incoming information. Meaning gets assigned based on our belief system.

Boundaries are critical to the proper functioning of healthy relationships. If you have good personal boundaries that are intact, meaning you can protect yourself and contain yourself (both). you will reduce the amount of victimization in the relationship.

INTIMACY
* A process of sharing the self with another person and/or receiving another person
physically, sexually, spiritually, intellectually, and/or emotionally
* This process creates a relationship
* A personal boundary problem occurs when one either has NO protection or NO
containment during intimacy (Boundaryless)
* A personal boundary problem occurs when one either has TOO much protection
or TOO much containment (Walls)

Making Amends
In an intimate exchange if one of the people in the exchange violates the other person's boundary (physical, sexual, internal) the violator is responsible for

Definition:
An acknowledgment that you did it and a pledge to work not to do it again.


*****PRESENTER NOTES*****

BEGINNING
“a system of limit setting that protects a person from being a victim and contains a person so that they are not offensive to others.”

Boundaries are like invisible fences which have 3 purposes:
* To keep people from coming into our space and abusing us
* To keep us from going into another person's space and abusing them
* To give us each a way to embody our sense of "who we are"
 
Most people are looking to be allowed to be who they are. People want to be affirmed in relationships and that is good as long as boundaries are not being violated.

END STEPS - How to make them operational?

Visualize the boundaries according to what they do.
 
Begin with the External physical boundary - your internal boundary will not work if you cannot get the external physical boundary correct. If there is abuse and a wall has been created for one of the boundary types it may be skipped until that person seeks therapy for it but it should be worked on as soon as possible.
