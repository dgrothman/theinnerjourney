# Boundaries
## What are boundaries?

Internal Boundary - I create what I think and feel and am in control of what I do and don't do. - I am responsible for how I create myself.


Taking responsibility in the relationship:
I NEED TO NOTE THE IMPACT I HAVE ON OTHERS AND THEY NEED TO NOTE THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON ME.
-Noting the impact means active listening and thinking about the impact we have on others. If we do not use the boundary by listening and noting the impact the boundary will become a wall.


Assigning meaning based on incoming information - We want to blame people for the emotional response we get from how we are assigning meaning to incoming information. Meaning gets assigned based on our belief system.


Boundaries are critical to the proper functioning of healthy relationships. If you have good personal boundaries that are intact, meaning you can protect yourself and contain yourself (both). you will reduce the amount of victimization in the relationship.


INTIMACY
* A process of sharing the self with another person and/or receiving another person
physically, sexually, spiritually, intellectually, and/or emotionally
* This process creates a relationship
* A personal boundary problem occurs when one either has NO protection or NO
containment during intimacy (Boundaryless)
* A personal boundary problem occurs when one either has TOO much protection
or TOO much containment (Walls)


Making Amends
In an intimate exchange if one of the people in the exchange violates the other person's boundary (physical, sexual, internal) the violator is responsible for


Definition:
An acknowledgment that you did it and a pledge to work not to do it again.

When we think of relationships, we think of love. When we think of boundaries, we think of limits. Boundaries
give us a sense of what is part of us and what is not a part of us, what we will allow and what we won't, what we
will choose to do and what we will choose not to do.
Boundary systems are invisible and symbolic "fences" that have three purposes: 

(1) to keep people from coming into our space and abusing us  
(2) to keep
us from going into the space of others and abusing them  
(3) to give each of us a way to embody our sense of "who we are".  

Boundary systems have two parts: external and internal

Our external boundary allows us to choose our distance from other people and enables us to give or refuse
permission for them to touch us. Our external boundary also keeps our bodies from offending someone else's
body. The external boundary is divided into two parts: physical and sexual. The physical part of our external
boundary controls how close we let people come to us and whether they can touch us or not. Also, if we have
intact external boundaries, we know to ask permisssion to touch other people and we are careful not to stand
too close to them for their comfort. 

In a similar way, our sexual boundary controls sexual distanct and touch


Our internal boundary protects our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keeps them functional. When we are
using our internal boundary, we can take responsibility for our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keep them
separate from that of others, and stop blaming them for what we think, feel and do. Our internal boundary also
allows us to stop taking responsibility for the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of others, allowing us to stop manipulating and controlling those around us.

### Healthy
  Healthy boundaries are like a door with a doorknob on the inside that we can choose when to open or close.
With intact flexible internal/ external boundaries people can have intimacy in their lives when they choose but
are protected against being abused physically, sexually, emotionally, intellectually or spiritually. We choose to allow or not and practice boundaries, choices, limits.

### None
No Boundaries. They have no sense of being abused or of being abusive. Such people have trouble saying No
or protecting themselves. They allow others to take advantage of them physically, sexually, emotionally, or
intellectually without clear knowledge that they have the right to say, "Stop that, I don't want to be touched" or
"I am not responsible for your feelings, thoughts, or behavior".
A codependent with No boundaries not only lacks protection but has not ability to recognize another person's
right to have boundaries with the codependent. Therefore, they move through other peoples boundaries
unaware that they are doing something inappropriate. Life crashes in doesn't know own Reality.

<br><br><br>

### Partial
Partial Boundaries. People with damaged boundaries can at times or with certain individuals say No, set limits
and take care of themselves. At other times or with other people they are powerless to set boundaries.
For instance, they may be able to set boundaries with everyone but authority figures, or his/her spouse, or
his/her child. In addition to, in certain circumstances they become offenders, stepping into someone else's life
and trying to control it or manipulate it.

### Walls

It is also quite common for a person to move from one kind of wall to another, **switching from anger to fear,
words, or silence at any time**, though always remaining invulnerable behind the walls. After a period of
loneliness they may venture out get pinged and quickly retreat back. The sad thing about walls is that although
they give solid protection, **they do not allow for intimacy** and leave the codependent even more isolated and
lonely.

#### Anger

People who use a wall of Anger give off the message (either verbally or nonverbally), if you come near me or
say anything about such-and-such, I'll explode! I might hit you or yell at you, so watch out! Others are afraid to
approach for fear of triggering that anger.

#### Fear

People who use a wall of fear retreat from others to keep safe. Such people don't go to parties, don't hang
around after meetings to chat. They emit an energy field that says don't come near me, or I'll fall apart. I'm so
fragile and afraid that I can't handle contact with anyone. Unfortunately, an offender is attracted to a person like
this, like a red cape to a bull. So this is not an effective method of protection from offenders.

#### Silence

The person using a wall of silence becomes quiet and does not emit an energy field of emotion like the people
using fear or anger, they fade into the woodwork. Another example would be some using the "silent treatment"

#### Words

The person using a wall of words often just talks right on, even when someone politely tries to contribute to the
conversation by making a comment or changing the subject. Talks over others and may ask a question and talk
right over the answer.
