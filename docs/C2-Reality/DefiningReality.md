# Defining Reality
The term reality refers to the fact that **each individual has his or her own unique way of interpreting life**.

Two people can see the **same event and have different thoughts and feelings and decide to do different things** because of the event.

But the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of each one are very real to that person and constitute his or her reality.

**Your reality comes from within you and mine comes from within me**, shaped by the way we respond to our environments and as a result of our history.

## Reality includes four ares:
1. Knowing what you look like and how your body is functioning.
2. Understanding and being aware of how you're thinking.
3. Recognizing and experiencing your emotions and feelings.
4. Being aware of your behavior and its impact on others.

Being aware of these four areas gives you a sense of who you are. And recovery is experiencing and sharing your personal environment in a more accurate and less skewed manner in all of the areas.

The **powerlessness** related to the Symptom of Codependency is this:
> You are not able to acknowledge or share one or more of your areas of reality. You are either aware of it but can't acknowledge it to others, or you are totally unaware of what your reality is.
