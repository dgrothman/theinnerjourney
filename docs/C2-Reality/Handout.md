# Reality

*From **Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J. Keith Miller*

## What is it?

* Each individual has their own unique way of interpreting life
* Reality comes from within  
* Reality is shaped by our history and the way we respond to the environment  
* Two people can experience the same event
  * Both have different thoughts and feelings about the event
  * Both decide to take different actions in response to the event

* **The Four Areas** of our Reality
  * **THINKING**: Understanding how we think and give meaning to sensory input
  * **FEELING**: Recognizing and experiencing our emotions
  * **BEHAVIOR**: What we do and don’t do; how it impacts others.
  * **BODY**: How we look and how our bodies function

## Can you own it?

* Codependents often say that they don’t know who they are
* Being aware of the four areas of our Reality gives us a sense of who we are
* The Inner Journey is about accurately experiencing and sharing your personal envionment 
* Difficulty owning your reality means
  * Struggling to experience who you are, and share that with others
    * This can occur in any or all of the four areas (thinking, feeling behavior, body)
  * We try to convince others of who we are (change their reality about us)
  * We try to control what others think to fulfill someone else’s expectations

* Owning our reality is on a gradient.
  * We may not know our reality or we may know it, but we are not able to share it; or we may know our reality and be able to share it regardless of what others may think.
  * Where we are at on the gradient may depend on the situation that we are in or the people we are interacting with

## What is the goal?

* Definition of a healthy, mature adult:
    * A person who can share their reality with another person without judgement or a need to fix, change, or teach anything  
* We accomplish this by learning to acknowledge, own, express, and support our reality
* We learn to accept others without judgment.

## Negative Control

* Our frustration and confusion as codependents stems primarily from our attempts to control the reality of others and from letting others control our reality.
* Negative control of reality happens when
  * I give myself permission to determine for another person what he or she should look like, think, feel, or do.
  * I allow someone else to determine what I should look like, think, feel, or do.
* Words of negative control include **should** (guilt trips), **always**, **never**, **need**.
* The oppositie of negative control is giving choices to another person.

<br><br>

## Reasons we refrain from telling others who we are

* Fear of rejection
* We are not sure who we are or what we want to say
* We have been inhibited and controlled by family (or family rules)
* We believe it is NOT okay to be who we are
* We don’t like ourselves
* We don’t trust our thoughts
* We don’t trust our feelings
* We don’t think our opinions are valuable
* We don’t think we have the right to say no
* We are not sure what we need or want
* We feel guilty about our needs and wants
* We feel ashamed of our problems
* We don’t trust our ability to identify problems

## Reality Tools

* Be aware  
    * Are others wanting to change your reality or are you wanting to change another’s reality? Did you give another permission to share their thoughts?

* Claim it  
  * Learn to surface, own, express, and support your own reality by becoming aware of your body, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors

* Own it  
  * Where are you at on the gradient and how do you strengthen your sense of reality by bringing your reality into your awareness then expressing your reality to others

* Practice
  * Allowing others to have their own reality even when it conflicts with your reality (about yourself)

* TRUE – NOT TRUE - QUESTIONABLE
  * Use a situation that you are dealing with, and ask yourself questions to find the truth of the situation (this may require a safe person to help give you perspective)  
  * The question you ask yourself is **Is it True, Not True, or Questionable that ...**
