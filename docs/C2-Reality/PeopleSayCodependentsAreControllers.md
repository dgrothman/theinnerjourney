## Why we control
1. We're "only trying to help"
2. We know best how things should go and how people should behave
3. We're right and they're wrong
4. We're afraid not to do it
5. We dont know what else to do
6. We think we have to
7. We dont think
8. Controlling is all we can thnk about

We aren't the people who "make things happen". Codependents are the people who consistently, with a great deal of effor and energy, try to **force** things to happen
