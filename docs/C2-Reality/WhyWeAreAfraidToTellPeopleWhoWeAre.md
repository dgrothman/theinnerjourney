# Why we are afraid to tell people who we are

1. Fear of rejection, after all, all we have is who we are.
2. Because we are not sure who we are and what we want to say.
3. Many of us have been inhibited and controlled by family and family rules.
4. We have learned to follow these rules to protect ourselves, to survive.
5. We’re afraid to communicate who we are because we believe it is not ok to be who we are.
6. We don’t like ourselves.
7. We don’t trust our thoughts.
8. We don’t trust our feelings.
9. We don’t think our opinions are valuable.
10. We don’t think we have the right to say no.
11. We are not sure what we need or want.
12. If we do know, we feel guilty about having needs and wants.
13. We may feel ashamed of our problems.
14. We don’t trust our ability to identify problems, and we’re more willing to back down if someone tells us the problem is not there.
