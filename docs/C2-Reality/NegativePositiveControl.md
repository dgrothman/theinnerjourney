# Negative Control / Positive Control
Our frustration and confusion as codependents stem primarily from our
attempts to control the reality of other people and from letting their reality
control us... A person’s reality is made up of the body, thinking, feelings,
and behavior. **“Positive Control” takes place when I determine my own
reality apart from the reality of others**... As a healthy person I am “in
control” of my reality, of knowing what it is, embracing it, and expressing it
when it’s in my best interest to do so. Positive control is recovery - the
opposite of negative control.

**Negative Control of reality happens whenever I give myself
permission to determine for another person what he or she should look like, or think, feel, or do or not do**.
On the other hand **allowing someone else to control me is also part of
the problem of negative control. Whenever I fail to determine for
myself what I look like, what I think, what I feel and what I do or don’t
do, and allow someone else to control any of these for me, I am
participating in negative control**.

## Negative Control Of Others
* **Thoughts** - Telling what to think, or being told
* **Feelings** - Telling how to feel, or being told
* **Choices** - Telling what to do, or being told
* **Limits** - Not hearing limits, or pushing others limits
* **Behavior** - Telling how to behave, or being told
* **Body** - Touching others without permission or being touched
* **Desires** - Telling what should want, or being told

## We want to allow others to own their own Reality
