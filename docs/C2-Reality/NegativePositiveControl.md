# Negative Control
Our frustration and confusion as codependents stem primarily from our
attempts to control the reality of other people and from letting their reality
control us... A person’s reality is made up of the body, thinking, feelings,
and behavior. 

Negative Control of reality happens whenever I give myself
permission to determine for another person what he or she should look like, or think, feel, or do or not do.
On the other hand, allowing someone else to control me is also part of
the problem of negative control. Whenever I fail to determine for
myself what I look like, what I think, what I feel and what I do or don’t
do, and allow someone else to control any of these for me, I am
participating in negative control.
