# Moderation
#### As a codependent, when you experience and express your physical, thinking, feeling, and behavior reality,you are either immature and out of control or overmature and extremely controlling. This symptom is sometimes referred to as the either/or syndrome or the all-or-nothing approach to life. It is both a symptom in itself and a characteristic of each of the other four symptoms.

| Symptom | One Extreme | The Other Extreme |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Self-Esteem** | Less Than | Better Than  |
| **Boundaries**    | Too Vulnerable | Invulnerable |
| **Reality**   | Rebellious / Bad | Perfect / Good |
| **Self Care**    | Too Dependent | Anti Dependent / Needless Wantless |
| **Moderation**   | Immature / Chaotic | Overmature / Controlling |
