# Moderation toolbox
#### Be moderate with your reality
This involves all of the core issues and requires discipline and focus. It is a
**centering** process and requires self-control. Codependents think, feel, and 
act in the extreme, and they present their bodies in the extreme.

Focus on the area of your reality you are presenting in the extreme and bring it into moderation
1. **Your Body -** are you dressing inappropriately for your age or size?
2. **Your Thinking -** is it extreme, disordered, irrational, black & white, right or wrong, good
or bad, or inordinate thinking? Moderating this may require professional help.
3. **Your Feelings -** they may be frozen/numb or explosive feelings. People with no internal
boundaries take in feelings from others, get overwhelmed, and then act them out. People with
frozen feelings are often overwhelmed when triggered by a sudden wave of old childhoold feelings,
and they act out in the extreme. It may take a therapist to relieve the intensity of that feeling reality.
4. **Your Behavior -** is your behavior immoderate? Notice how your behavior is in the extreme - how
you don't respond or over-respond. You need to respond moderately. Tune in and become a moderate person.
