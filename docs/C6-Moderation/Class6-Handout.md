title: Moderation - Handout

# Moderation  

## Codependency is about  

* Our belief system
    * Our past or history
    * Our present or the filter we view life through
* Extremes
    * Completely happy – Absolutely miserable
    * Thoroughly enmeshed – Totally detached
    * If you do not agree with me unconditionally, then you are against me entirely
* Value
    * Who holds my value?

## Source of moderation issues

* Observing and reacting to immoderate caregivers
    * Exhibiting the opposite behavior
    * Do you reflexively react or choose to respond?
* Feeling invisible
    * Childhood needs were ignored
    * Wants were the focus
    * Extreme behaviors received attention
* Repetition Compulsion
    * Desire to fix something or master something from our past
* Value
    * Do we need to check it out?
* Overwhelm = Moderation issues

## Moderation is

* Balance
    * Let the pendulum swing from one extreme to the other
    * To find the calm in the middle
    * Do not have to do more today than what is reasonable
* Empathy
    * Having strong internal boundaries
    * Sharing an experience without sharing the feelings
* Acceptance
    * Moments in time do NOT define us (we are NOT our behavior)
    * Making a mistake is only that (mistakes are normal)
    * Avoid the shame bind
    * Welcome vulnerability causes fear to recede

## Moderation and Reality

* Body
    * How a person dresses or sees themselves
* Thinking
    * Black or white; right or wrong; good or bad
* Behavior
    * Extreme behaviors: over the top or absent
* Feelings
    * Adult Feeling: mature, authentic, emotional response to thoughts
        * Indicates our Reality, Boundaries, Self Care are functioning in a healthy manner
    * Adult-Induced Feeling: the result of empathy
        * Indicates our Reality, Boundaries, Self Care are functioning in a healthy manner
    * Frozen Feelings from Childhood: frozen in moment of time
        * Anger, pain, or fear
        * May respond in ways that are not age appropriate
        * May have minimal emotional response to significant event
    * Adult-to-Child Carried Feelings: starts in childhood and carries into adult life
        * Feel overwhelmed and out of control (Shame)

## Love Addiction

* Takes two
    * The Love Addict
        * Attracted to power and adulation
        * When attention fades, obsesses about - then acts on - how to get it back
        * Repeats cycle
    * The Avoidance Addict
        * Attracted to neediness and vulnerability
        * But then feels smothered by neediness and abandons relationship
        * Repeats cycle: out of fear of abandonment or guilt
    * What if there is only one?
* Do not replace coping skills with a relationship
* Do not be so open that you forfeit your ability to sort, filter, or reject
    * Remember true, not true, or questionable (Know YOUR reality)
* Behaviors to strive for
    * Show up and be present
    * Let go of expectations and honor the power of “no”
* Healthy intimacy
    * Trust and acceptance of our true selves
* Love is about knowing someone matters
    * It is free of manipulation
