title: Moderation - Handout

# Moderation  

## Codependency is about  

* Our belief system
    * Our past or history
    * Our present or the filter we view life through
* Extremes
    * Completely happy – Absolutely miserable
    * Thoroughly enmeshed – Totally detached
    * If you do not agree with me unconditionally, then you are against me entirely
* Value
    * Who holds my value?

## Source of moderation issues

* Observing and reacting to immoderate caregivers
    * Exhibiting the opposite behavior
* Feeling invisible
    * Childhood needs were ignored
    * Wants were the focus
    * Extreme behaviors received attention
* Value
    * Do we need to check it out?

## Moderation is

* Balance
    * Let the pendulum swing from one extreme to the other
    * To find the calm in the middle
    * Do not have to do more today that what is reasonable
* Empathy
    * Having strong internal boundaries
    * Sharing an experience without sharing the feelings
* Acceptance
    * Moments in time do NOT define us (we are NOT our behavior)
    * Making a mistake is only that (mistakes are normal)
    * Avoid the shame bind

## Moderation and Reality

* Body
    * How a person dresses or sees themselves
* Thinking
    * Black or white; right or wrong; good or bad
    * Catastrophe vs. bliss
    * (See ANTs - Automatic Negative Thoughts)

    * Frozen Feelings from Childhood: frozen in moment of time
        * Anger, pain, or fear
        * Taught to NOT have feelings

        * May have minimal emotional response to significant event
        * Feelings are shut off
    * Adult-to-Child Carried Feelings: starts in childhood and carries into adult life
        * Shame
        * Feel overwhelmed and out of control
        * Not sure where the feelings are coming from
            * Gets added to the current feelings we are having, for example changing a level 4 feeling to a level 10 feeling
