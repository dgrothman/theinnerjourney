## Class Description
The Inner Journey is an 8-week class that goes through the 5 core symptoms based off 
***Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, & J. Keith Miller*. 
We work through each symptom and discuss tools and perspectives that help to create a 
framework for handling life as it comes, rather than being handled by life.

## Class Breakdown

#### [Class 1 - Safe People](/C1-SafePeople/SafePeople/)

We discuss what a safe person is, and how to identify them along with what the characteristics of the
four different personalities of the color code are.

#### [Class 2 - Reality](/C2-Reality/DifficultyOwningOurOwnReality/)

We help define what your reality is made up of and why it is so important as to how you interpret life, we also look at how we use negative control
to try and change another person's reality, or let them control our reality.

#### [Class 3 - Reality Part 2 Feelings](/C3-Feelings/AutomaticNegativeThoughts/)

We dig into some more important items about reality, specifically. The Drama Triangle, what it is and how to 
identify if you are in it. The positive and negative sides of our feelings, and how to identify them, and control them.

#### [Class 4 - Boundaries](/C4-Boundaries/WhatAreBoundaries/)

Now that we have started to understand how do we protect that, and protect us from forcing that reality onto others?
Boundaries are how, they are the containers of our Reality. Not only do they protect us, but they also protect others
from us.

#### [Class 5 - Wants & Needs](/C5-SelfCare/DifficultyAknowledingNeedsWants/)

Knowing our wants and needs is a pivotal step in creating connection in relationships, as well
as balancing the share of their needs and wants along with your own needs and wants. This in
conjunction with bringing your own reality and boundaries in moderation into the relationship
creates the connection that is fulfilling for both people involved.

#### [Class 6 - Moderation](/C6-Moderation/Moderation/)

As you grow you start to become aware of areas that are over-the-top or suppressed both of
which are not moderate, and then as you bring those areas into healing you will start to notice they get pulled back
to a more balanced moderate response.
Moderation is the balancing piece that ties very closely to your reality and boundaries, all three combined 
to give you a sense of your own empowerment and value.

#### [Class 7 - Self Esteem](/C7-SelfEsteem/TheLie/)

Value is what we all strive for, and in the weeks lesson we dig into the different types and how we can work to keep it within ourselves, as well as becoming aware of when we have placed it outside of ourselves and therefor are trying to control others.

#### [Class 8 - Grace, Truth & Time](/C8-GraceTruthTime/GraceTruthTime/)

Now that we have the tools we to work through re-parenting ourselves. These last ingredients are a big help in keeping us moving
along the journey
