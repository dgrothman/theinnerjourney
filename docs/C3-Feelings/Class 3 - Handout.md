# Feelings

## What generates them?

*From **Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J. Keith Miller*

* The four areas of **REALITY**
    * **BODY**: 
      * Our five senses bring input from outer world to our inner world
    * **THINKING**: 
      * We interpret, draw conclusions, and give meaning to the sensory input
    * **FEELING**: 
      * Physiological response to our thoughts (also called emotions)
      * Uses up energy in our body
    * **BEHAVIOR**: 
      * What we choose to do (or not do) as a result of our feelings
* Our belief system (based on our history and values) affects the way we think, feel, and behave
* How we process our thoughts impacts where our feelings go (positive or negative) &amp; intensity of them
  * What we feel is what we feel
  * We cannot change our feelings
  * We can change our thoughts
* We learn to acknowledge it so we can process it
  * Denied feelings are a trigger for inappropriate behavior
  * Unprocessed feelings are stored in our bodies, they dont just dissapear because we choose not to process them

## Tools for Feelings

* Allow yourself to feel them
  * Let them be as big (or little) and overwhelming/confusing (ugly) as they really are
* Find the truth
  * What/who is the source (external or internal)?
  * Is there an event that triggered it?
  * Use the True – Not True – Questionable Tool to separate the feelings from the thoughts
* Talk them out with a safe person
* Purge them
  * Journal? Art?
  * Physical: clean the house, beat up a pillow, break dishes, throw darts at a picture
  * Express them in a way that does not harm you, others, or valuable property

## Automatic Negative Thoughts

*from **Change Your Brain Change Your Life** by Daniel Amen*

* Negative thoughts invade your mind like ants at a picnic
  * When you notice an ANT enter your mind, acknowlege it and talk back to it
  * When you hear your self talk use an ANT, stop and correct yourself
* All or Nothing
  * Everything is all good or all bad; same as black and white thinking
  * One event/moment doesn’t define the entirety
* Always Thinking
  * Overgeneralize: using words like “always” or ”never”
  * Helplessness that you do not have control over your behavior/self
* Focusing on the Negative
  * Only see the negative aspect of a situation regardless of the positives
  * Hopelessness or wanting to “give up”
* Thinking with your Feelings
  * Assuming our feeling is correct versus questioning it; feelings can lie
  * Use the True – Not True – Questionable Tool
* Guilt Beating
  * Using guilt to control our behavior or using negative control on others
  * When we feel pushed to do something, our natural tendency is to push back
* Labeling
  * Calling yourself (or another) a negative term or name
  * Worthlessness, helplessness, and hopelessness; giving up before trying
* Fortune-Telling (**RED ANT**)
  * Predicting the worse even though you don’t know what will happen
* Mind Reading (**RED ANT**)
  * Assuming you know what another is thinking
* Blame (**RED ANT**)
  * Blaming others and not taking responsibility for ourselves
  * Powerless to change our own behavior

  * Let pain lead and guide us to a positive outcome (healthy choices/behaviors)
  * Stop or avoid pain (addictions, focus on others, denial/repression)

* Can be confused with Anger

## Anger 

*from **Good ‘n’ Angry: How to Handle Your Anger Positively** by Les Carter*

* Three general ways people handle anger
* Repressed (denial)
  * If I ignore it, it will go away
  * Pushing from conscious to subconscious leads to it worsening
* Expressed (outwardly communicated)
  * Assertive: respects the dignity/value of another
  * Aggressive: without regard for other person’s worth/value
* Released (let it go)
  * Making the conscious decision that anger is no longer needed
  * Must first be able to assertively express anger

* By confronting a situation or “doing something”

## Shame 

*from **Letting Go of Shame** by Ronald and Patricia Potter-Efron*

* Represents a person’s identity
* Defense mechanisms: denial, perfectionism, arrogance, exhibitionism, rage
* Become aware of your shame and examine it even though we want to hide from it
  * Where does your shame come from? (society, family, significant other, yourself)
* Shame heals when shared with another
* Set positive goals and take responsibility for reformating your thoughts and changing your behaviors
* Usually is accompanied by Guilt
