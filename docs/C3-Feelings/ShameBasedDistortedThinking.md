# Shame-Based Distorted Thinking
### From *Healing The Shame That Binds You* by John Bradshaw
#### Catastrophizing
A headache signals an impending brain tumor. A memo to see the boss means you're going to get fired. Catastrophizing results from having no boundaries or sense of worth. There are no limits to the "what ifs" that can occur.
The most logical counter to catastrophizing is an honest assessment in terms of realistic odds or percent of probability. What are the chances? One in a thousand (1%) or one in 100,000 (.001%)?

#### Mind-Reading
You make assumptions (without evidence) about how people are reacting to you. "I can tell by their faces, that they're getting ready to fire me." "She thinks I'm immature or she wouldn't ask me these questions." These assumptions are usually born of intuition, hunches, vague misgivings, or one or two past experiences. Mind-reading depends on projection. You imagine that people feel as bad about you as you do about yourself. As a shame-based person, you are critical and judgmental of yourself. You assume others feel the same way about you.
Mind-reading is a form of imagining and fantasizing. In the long run you're best off making no inferences about people. Treat all your interpretations about other people as hallucinations. Use that word when you give your interpretation. The best policy is to check out the evidence for your conclusion.

#### Personalization
Shame-based people are egocentric. They relate everything to themselves. Personalization involves the habit of continually comparing yourself to other people. This is a consequence of the perfectionistic system that fosters shame. A perfectionistic system demands comparison. The list of comparisons never ends. The underlying assumption is that your worth is questionable.
Force yourself to get evidence to prove what the boss's frown means. Check it out if possible. Abandon the habit of comparing. Make no conclusion unless you have reasonable evidence and proof.

#### Overgeneralization
This distortion results from the toxic shame's grandiosity. One slipped stitch means. "I'll never learn to sew." A turn-down for a date means "Nobody will ever go out with me." In this thinking distortion you make a broad, generalized conclusion based on a single incident or piece of evidence.
Write on a 3X5 card, "There Are No Absolutes" and put it on your desk. Challenge words like all, every, never, always, nobody, everybody by exaggerating them. Say: Do I really mean I never, never, never, etc? Learn to use words like maybe, sometimes, often.

#### Either/Or Thinking
Another consequence of shame-based grandiosity is polarized thinking or either/or thinking. The chief mark of this thought distortion is an insistence on dichotomous choices: You perceive everything in extremes. There is no middle ground. People and things are either good or bad, wonderful or terrible. The most destructive aspect of this thought distortion is its impact on how you judge yourself. If you're not brilliant or error-free, then you must be a failure. There is no room for mistakes.
There are no black and white judgements. The world is grey. Think in terms of percentages. About 5% of the time I'm selfish, but the rest of the time I'm loving and generous.

#### Being Right
As a shame-based person, you must continually prove that your viewpoint and actions are correct. You live in a completely defensive posture. Since you cannot make a mistake, you aren't interested in the truth of other opinions, only in defending your own. This thought distortion really keeps you in the shame squirrel cage, because you rarely hear any new information. You get no new data that would help you change your belief system about yourself.
Own your own good healthy shame. If you're always right, you stop listening and learning. The key to overcoming being right is to become an active listener. As an active listener you listen for the content
as well as the process. You learn to listen with your ears as well as your eyes. You learn to give feedback and to check things out. This helps us to grasp the other's point of view. It is important to remember that others believe what they are saying as strongly as we believe our own convictions. I like to ask myself, "What can I learn from the other person's opinion?"

#### "Should" Thinking
Should thinking is a direct result of perfectionism. In this thought distortion you operate from a list of inflexible rules about how you and other people should act. The rules are right and indisputable. The most common cue words for this thought distortion are should, ought, and must. A shame-based person with this thought distortion makes both himself and others miserable.
Use the words should, ought, and must as red flags. Flexible rules and expectations don't use these words because there are always exceptions and special circumstances. Rigidity is a mark of mental illness; flexibility is the mark of mental health. Without flexibility, there is no freedom.

#### Control Thinking Fallacies
Control is a major cover up for toxic shame. Control is a product of grandiosity and distorts thinking in two ways. You see yourself as helpless and externally controlled or as omnipotent and responsible foreverythingaroundyou. Youdon'tbelievethatyouhaveanyrealcontrolovertheoutcomeofyour life. Thiskeepsyoustuckandinyourshamecycle. Theoppositefallacyisthefallacyofomnipotent control. You feel responsible for everything and everybody. You carry the world on your shoulders and feel guilty when it doesn't work out.
Aside from acts of God, you are responsible for what happens in your world. Learning to be responsible and to allow others that privilege is to live in reality. Ask yourself, "What choices have I made that resulted in this situation? What decisions can I now make to change it?" Also remember that respect for others means letting them live their own lives, suffer their own pains and solve their own problems.

#### Cognitive Deficiency or Filtering
You pick out one element of a situation to the exclusion of everything else. The detail you pick out supports your belief about your personal defectiveness. Filtering is a way to magnify and "awfulize" your thoughts. This triggers powerful shame spirals.
Stop using words like terrible, awful, disgusting, horrendous, etc. Write out the phrase "No need to magnify. Icancope. Icanstandit." AfavoritephrasefromAbrahamLowis"Thisisdistressing,but not dangerous." To stop filtering you have to shift focus. Place your attention on coping strategies to deal with the problem rather than obsessing on the problem itself.

#### Blaming and Global Labeling
Blaming is a cover-up for shame and a way to pass it on to others. Blaming lends itself to global labeling. Your grocery store has rotten food. The prices are a rip-off. A reserved and quiet person on a date is a dull wallflower. Your boss is a gutless dumbo.
Accept responsibility for your own behavior and choices. Focus on your own problems. Look at the beam in your own eye, rather than the speck in your brother's eye. When you start labeling, ask yourself "What am I trying to avoid?" If you find you are not avoiding, be specific rather than global. My boss is often conservative. He is rarely a risk-taker. This is accurate. Calling him a gutless dumbo is about your need to vent anger at your own situation by having to answer to him.
