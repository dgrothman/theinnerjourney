# Feelings Chart
### According to Pia Mellody's *Facing Codependency*
#### **Thoughts** - the brain assigning meaning to incoming data
#### **Feelings** - the physiological response to a chemical reaction in the brain
#### **Emotions** - the name the brain assigns to that physiological response
#### **Behavior** - what we choose to do or not do as a result of our feelings
*Thus, our feelings are created (and controlled) by our thoughts (our brain). And our behavior is created by our emotions.*
