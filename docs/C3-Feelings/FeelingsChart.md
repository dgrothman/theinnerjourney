# Feelings Chart

*According to Pia Mellody's **Facing Codependency***

#### Thoughts
- the brain assigning meaning to incoming data

#### Feelings
- the physiological response to a chemical reaction in the brain

#### Emotions
- the name the brain assigns to that physiological response

#### Behavior
- what we choose to do or not do as a result of our feelings

*Thus, our feelings are created (and controlled) by our thoughts (our brain). And our behavior is created by our emotions.*
