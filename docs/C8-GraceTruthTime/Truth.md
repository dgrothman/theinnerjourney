# Truth
What is the truth? The simplest way to think of truth is in terms of reality. Reality is truth, and ultimate reality is Gods truth. He has described his reality in ways that we can understand it and in ways that can heal us and help us grow. His truth is a prescription for us to live. Since He is life and has created life. Then He best understands it and how it is to be lived. His truth and precepts are the way to the ultimate life.

God's truth structures our lives. It gives the shape to our character and our existence, showing us the way to live.

For any system of growth to work, it must include God's truth. We must be getting it in some sort of systematic and experiential way for it to do its work in our lives. In Psalms, David said, I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have preserved my life. For His truth to preserve our lives we must be exposed to God's truth.

Hearing his truth is only part of the matter. The other aspect is putting it into practice. As Jesus said, wise is the person who not only hears His word but puts it into practice (Lk 6:47).

# OUR TRUTH
However, there is more to reality then the precepts of God. There is the reality of who we are and this truth needs to be present in our system of growth as well. If we are hiding our reality. Thoughts, Feelings, Choices, Limits, Behavior, Desires and Body. Then it is not being effected by the grace that God gives to us. We bring our reality into the truth of relationship via Grace, with God and others. Listen to the following verses:

Search me, O God, and know my heart, test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting (Ps 139: 23,24)

If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (John 1:9)

Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. (James 5:16)

For Grace to effect our skewed realities, those realities need to be brought into the light of His truth where we begin to feel His acceptance. When we understand who we are through His reality and who he's created us to be and the fact that He and others love us just the way we are. That love empowers us and motivates us to change.
