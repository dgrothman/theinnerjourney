# Grace, Truth & Time
### What are they and why are they so important?
The three ingredients of growth! When they all come together we can for the first time have the true self loved and accepted and grow in the likeness of God.

**Grace** is the first ingredient. There's no way to earn it or deserve it, anymore than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream, or earn good looks or bring about your own birth.

Grace is the unmerited favor of God, toward people. To put it another way, Grace is unconditional love and acceptance. Such love is the foundation upon which all healing of the human spirit rests. God loves us freely, without condition. It says that you are accepted just like you are and that you will not be shamed or incur wrath for whatever you are experiencing.

**Truth** is the second ingredient necessary for growing up. Truth is what is real, it describes how things really are. Just as Grace is the relational aspect of God's character. Truth is the structural aspect of His character, the skeleton life hangs on.

Truth implies many things, but in relationships it implies honesty, being real with one another, and living out the truth of God. Many people think that safe relationships are relationships that just give grace without confrontation, but ultimately these relationships can be destructive as well.

We need safe people in our life that will be honest with us, telling us where we are wrong and where we need to change.

**Time** is the third ingredient. The Bible tells us that in order for grace and truth to produce fruit we need a third element, time. Time joined by Grace and Truth.

Time is not just an act of God's grace to us, "giving us some space." He is much too loving to allow us to continue in sin for one minute longer than necessary. Time is not a luxury but a necessity.

We will also learn about good and bad time and how all the ingredients work together. Helping us grow into Healthy Mature Adults and how to extend these things to ourselves and others. As we are growing into His image.
