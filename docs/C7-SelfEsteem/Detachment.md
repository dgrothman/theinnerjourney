# Detachment from an addicted relationship
#### From _Facing Love Addiction_ by Pia Mellody

### Practice "the three gets" from Al-Anon:
1. **Get off your partner's back**
means to stop looking intently at the other party, to stop paying attention to what your partner is doing or not doing,
and regard it as none of your business. It is helpful merely to notice what your partner is doing or not doing; this can
help break through the fantasy you have created about who the person is in order to see who he or she really is. To get off
your partner's back means to cease responding to what your partner is doing or not doing by expressing an opinion or feeling
to him or her, offering a "suggestion" or solution, asking you partner to change, and so on.
2. **Get out of your partner's way** means to try not to interfere with or eve observe and evaluate what's going on in your
partner's life. Getting out of the way of the other person means to try and give helpful advice or negative comments, not
to help the other person avoid catastrophe, but also not to create a catastrophe. Make all of your partner's observed behavior
none of your business
3. **Get on with your life** means to get into recovery from any addictions you have and from codependency. Most of all, 
for Love Addicts getting on with your life means to learn how to take care of your needs and wants yourself, to take adult
responsibility for your own care, and to stop trying to get somebody else to do it for you. Also learn to focus on how to
value yourself, how to set your boundaries, and how to own your own reality.

### Do not "bomb" you partner with anger or seduction
When you have effectively accomplished this detachment, the intensity subsides and the environment may get extremely quiet,
especially in comparison to the way it was. When either one feels the discomfort of detachment, they are tempted to do something
called "bombing" to create the old, familiar intensity with the partner, which feels intimate even if it doesn't feel good.
Bombing attempts to create so much intensity, either with angry fights or with forms of seduction, that the partner will
break the detachment, respond, and reconnect, even if the connection is toxic.

### Notice what is happening to your partner so you can see who your partner is
### Notice what is going on with you
### Do not respond to any bombs of anger or seduction from your partner
