# Self Esteem (Value)

## What is it?

*From **Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J. Keith Miller*

* Healthy self-esteem is the internal experience of one's own preciousness and value as a person
    * Comes from inside
    * Moves outward into relationships
    * Doesn't change based on behavior or surroundings

<br><br>

## What is the issue?

*From **Facing Codependence** by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J. Keith Miller*

* Codependents have difficulty with self-esteem at one or both extremes
  * Low self-esteem
    * I think I am worth less than others
    * I dont measure up
  * Arrogant
    * I think I am superior to others
    * I have learned to find faults in others, making them inferior to me
* Both of these types of self-esteem result in what is called "Other-Esteem"
  * I get my value (sense of worth) from external things
    * It is based on my "human doing" or in the opinions and behavior of other people
    * Some examples
      * How I look
      * How much money I make
      * What I know
      * What kind of car I drive
      * What kind of job I have
      * How well my children behave
      * How attractive or powerful my spouse is
      * How well I perform

## Understanding the Drama Triangle

* The Drama Triangle (The 3 faces of victim)
  * Generates shame
    * through internal interaction or external communication keeps the shame messages going
  * Victim
    * A twisted version of the desire to be innocent and vulnerable
    * Comes from an unconscious need to feel important
    * Becoming helpless 
    * Deny their problem-solving abilities and potential for self-generated value
    * Making themselves helpless becomes the primary way of avoiding failure
    * Comes across as less than
    * The Persecutor stage looks like resentment
    * The Rescuer stage is done from a less than position
  * Rescuer
    * A twisted version of the desire to nurture and protect
    * Comes from an unconscious need to feel important
    * Taking care of others is how the Rescuer connects or feels worth
    * Deny their needs
    * Often operates out of the desire to eventually be taken care of
    * Making themselves indispensable becomes a primary way of avoiding abandonment
    * Comes across as better than
    * The Victim stage looks like depression and martyrdom
    * The Persecutor stage look like withdrawing
  * Persecutor
    * A twisted version of the desire to protect and provide
    * Uses anger to hide their feelings of worthlessness
    * Comes from the unconscious need to feel important
    * Blaming others is how the Persecutor feels worth
    * Deny their weaknesses
    * Must be right
    * Making themselves right becomes the primary way of avoiding powerlessness
    * Comes across as better than
    * The Victim stage is used to blame other for the way they act
    * The Rescue stage is also painful and done in anger
  * Rescuer and Persecutor are opposite extremes of victim
  * All roles eventually lead back to victim
  * Many family's only communicate in this way
  * We all have a starting position
  * We can act out this drama triangle in our everyday relations
  * We can act out this drama triangle internally within our thoughts
    * We can trap ourselves with dishonest and dysfunctional internal dialogue

  * Allow other to have their feelings
* Be willing to let go of the drama produced
  * Set boundaries
