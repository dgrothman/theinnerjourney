# The Lie
### Our Self Esteem = Our Performance + Others = Opinions
#### From **Searching For Significance** by Robert S. McGee
| False Beliefs | Consequences | God's Solution | Results |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **The Performance Trap** I must meet certain standards in order to feel good about myself | The fear of failure; perfectionism;driven to succeed; manipulating others to achieve success; withdrawal from risks | **Justification** Justification means that God has not only forgiven me of my sins, but has also granted me the righteousness of Christ. Because of justification, I bear Christâ€™s righteousness and am, therefore, fully pleasing to the Father (Romans 5:1).  | Increasing freedom from the fear of failure; desire to pursue the right things; Christ and His kingdom; love for Christ
| **Approval Addict** I must be approved (accepted) by certain others to feel good about myself | The fear of rejection; attempting to please others at any cost; overly sensitive to criticism; withdrawing from others to avoid disapproval. | **Reconciliation** Reconciliation means that although I was at one time hostile toward God and alienated from Him, I am now forgiven and have been brought into an intimate relationship with Him. Consequently, I am totally accepted by God (Col. 1:21-22). | Increasing freedom from the fear of rejection; willingness to be open and vulnerable; able to relax around others; willingness to take criticism; desire to please God no matter what others think
| **The Blame Game** Those who fail are unworthy of love and deserve to be punished | The fear of punishment; punishing others; blaming others for personal failure; withdrawal from God and others; driven to avoid failure. | **Propitiation** Propitiation means that Christ satisfied God's wrath by His death on the cross; therefore, I am deeply loved by God (1John 4:9-11). | Increasing freedom from the fear of punishment; patience and kindness toward other; being quick to apply forgiveness; deep love for Christ
| **Shame** I am what I am. I cannot change. I am hopeless. | Feelings of shame; hopelessness; inferiority; passivity; loss of creativity; isolation; withdrawal from others | **Regeneration** Regeneration means that I am a new creation in Christ (John 3:3-6). | Christ-centered self-confidence; joy; courage; peace; desire to know Christ
