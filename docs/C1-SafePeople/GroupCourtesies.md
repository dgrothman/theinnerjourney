# Group Courtesies
1. Please be on time to group sessions. We will begin and end each session on
time.
2. We ask you to share, but no one should feel pressured to participate and may
pass.
3. Look on the group sessions as a place for everyone to process their options,
and not just a venting place for yourself. Limit your sharing so that others in
the group will be able to share.
4. Try to share from the heart as honestly as you can. You can cry, laugh, be
angry in the group, without the fear of condemnation from others.
5. Please do not sit in judgement on another group member or verbally attack
another group member.
6. Please...NO CROSS TALK. Cross talk occurs when individuals speak
out of turn and interrupt one another. The group is disrupted, and it loses its
focus of respect for the member whose turn it is to speak.
7. Avoid offering suggestions or methods of fixing. We are here to listen, to
support, and to be supported by each other in the group, not to give advice.
Please save any questions until after the group is dismissed.
8. Speak in the "I" form instead of "we", "they", or "you." This helps us
take responsibility for our feelings and accept them as being valid.Examples:
"I believe....," rather than "They say...." "I felt angry that....," rather than
"She made me so angry...."
9. We ask that you respect the anonymity and confidentiality of each person in
this meeting. Remember: **WHO YOU SEE HERE, WHAT IS SAID
HERE, WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE, LET IT STAY HERE.**
