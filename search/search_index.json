Obviously, the circumstances are going to have an influence on how one chooses to deal with anger. There are three general styles in which people can handle anger:</p> <ol> <li>Repressed Anger</li> </ol> <p>Many people are afraid of anger and try to avoid it at all costs. When the emotion surfaces, they do their best to pretend it is not there. Their reasoning (conscious or subconscious) is that if one ignores anger, it will go away. Most of these people either have been taught openly to avoid anger or have learned through bitter experience how painful anger can be.</p> <p>Repression is a form of denial. If a person denies that he is angry, then he feels no obligation to deal with his anger. The problem is solved (temporarily). Repression may have its short-term rewards, but in the long run repressed anger is usually especially powerful and bitter. By repressing it, a person is pushing anger from the conscious to the subconscious. There it can fester and worsen without that person\u2019s knowledge. 2. Expressed Anger</p> <p>As a culture, Americans are quickly losing any sense of bashfulness. The prevailing mood is that if you have been offended, get angry! Certainly, we are in a period where it is acceptable, even fashionable, to \u201clet it all hang out.\u201d Anger can be assertive, or it can be aggressive. Assertive anger means that people stand up for their convictions in a manner that respects another\u2019s dignity. Aggressive anger may also be stated firmly, but without true regard for the other person\u2019s worth. Therefore, when people express anger, that expression may be correct or incorrect, depending on the level of sensitivity to others. Nonetheless, expressed anger is anger that is communicated outwardly.</p> <p>Certain guidelines should be followed to make sure that expressed anger works for us instead of against us.</p> <ul> <li>Be sure that when you express anger you do not attempt to establish your own sense of   superiority. This could cause the recipient of your anger to harbor resentment.</li> <li>Make sure your anger has a constructive aim. Anger expressed for the sake of meanness is just going to create an atmosphere that will breed more anger.</li> <li>Be aware of the responsiveness of the recipient. Make sure the other party is ready to hear what you have to say.</li> <li> <p>Consider the feelings and circumstances of the recipient. There will be times when your anger may be completely correct, but you will not be able to communicate it constructively due to the mind-set of the other person.</p> </li> <li> <p>Released Anger</p> </li> </ul> <p>Released anger refers to anger that is dismissed or let go. It is not to be confused with repressed anger. Repressed anger is simply pushed into the subconscious mind. But when anger is released, the person has made the conscious decision that anger is no longer needed and it is therefore dropped. People can gain the ability to release anger only after they first gain some mastery of the art of expressing anger. After anger has served its purpose (or if one sees that it has no good purpose) the mature individual will have enough sense to let go of it.</p> <p>Understanding the three general ways of handling anger makes it possible for you to examine your patterns of dealing with anger. Certainly, it is not always best to express anger. There are times when that would do more harm than good. It definitely is not best to try to repress anger so that it is merely out of the conscious mind. And there are times when it is right and times when it is wrong to release it. We each need to come up with our own personalized game plan for how we will handle anger. The better control we have over it, the more anger will work in our favor.</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/LettingGoOfGuilt/","title":"Letting Go Of Guilt","text":"<p>From Mind Over Emotions by Dr. Les Carter </p> <p>Although some guilt can be totally debilitating, this emotion is given to us for positive reasons. Originally God gave it to mankind to serve the redemptive purpose of bringing all individuals into the right fellowship with Him. Through guilt we are each challenged to come to grips with the sense of right and wrong established by God. In both His written Word and each person's sense of conscience, God reveals the basic laws of morality and truth and exhorts individuals to draw close to Him. Just as physical pain communicates that something is amiss in one's body, guilt can communicate that all is not right in one's style of living and thinking. It is important to understand that there are two kinds of guilt:</p> <ol> <li> <p>True guilt is the constructive feeling of remorse based on a reasonable understanding of God's standard of right and wrong. For example, when a person tells a lie, he feels guilty. Inwardly he knows that he has violated one of God's directives. Therefore, because of his sense of regret, he atones for his error, making the necessary corrections. True guilt is the inner voice that instructs the individual to choose right over wrong. It is the emotion that leads a person to live a life of moral responsibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>False guilt is a feeling of remorse that assumes a judgmental posture toward oneself (note that judging is entirely different from examining oneself). False guilt involves a subjective condemnation in light of the fact that a wrong has been committed. Attached to false guilt is the fear of being found out and the fear of receiving harsh punishment. This type of guilt usually has negative repercussions because it hinders a person from accepting the fullness of God's forgiveness. The experience of false guilt is inappropriate because it encourages a person to feel that he has no value because of personal sins.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Notice the differences between true guilt and false guilt. Whereas true guilt causes a person to draw closer to God, false guilt creates a sense of isolation or estrangement from Him. True guilt brings improvement to a person's life; false guilt causes life to lose its joy. True guilt produces a humble, repentant spirit; false guilt produces feelings of defeat and degradation.</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/StoppingOurPain/","title":"Stopping Our Pain","text":"<p>From The Language of Letting Go by Melody Beattie </p> <p>There are so many sources of pain in our life. Those of us recovering from adult children and codependency issues frequently have a cesspool of unresolved pain from the past. We have feelings, sometimes from early childhood to the present, that either hurt too much to feel or that we had no support and permission to deal with.</p> <p>There are other inevitable sources of pain in our life too. There is the sadness and grief that comes when we experience change, even good change, as we let go of one part of our life and begin our journey into the new.</p> <p>There is the pain that leads and guides us into better choices for our future.</p> <p>We have many choices about how to stop this pain. We may have experimented with different options. Compulsive and addictive behaviors stop pain - temporarily. We may have used alcohol, other drugs, relationships, or sex to stop our pain.</p> <p>We may talk compulsively or compulsively focus on other people and their needs as a way to avoid or stop our pain.</p> <p>We may use religion to avoid our feelings.</p> <p>We may resort to denial of how we are feeling to stop our pain.</p> <p>We may stay so busy that we don't have time to feel. We may use money, exercise, or food to stop our pain.</p> <p>We have many choices. To survive, we may have used some of these options, only to find that these were Band-Aids - temporary pain relievers that did not solve the problem. They did not really stop our pain; they postponed it.</p> <p>In recovery, there is a better choice about how we may stop pain. We can face it and feel it. When we are ready, with our Higher Power's help, we can summon the courage to feel the pain, let it go, and let the pain move us forward - into a new decision, a better life.</p> <p>We can stop the behaviors we are doing that cause pain, if that's appropriate. We can make a decision to remove ourselves from situations that cause repeated, similar pain. We can learn the lesson our pain is trying to teach us.</p> <p>If we are being pelted by pain, there is a lesson. Trust that idea. Something is being worked out in us. The answer will not come from addictive or other compulsive behaviors; we will receive the answer when we feel our feelings.</p> <p>It takes courage to be willing to stand still and feel what we must feel. Sometimes, we have what seems like endless layers of pain inside us. Pain hurts. Grief hurts. Sadness hurts. It does not feel good. But neither does denying what is already there; neither does living a lifetime with old and new pockets of pain packed, stored, and stacked within.</p> <p>It will only hurt for a while, no longer than necessary, to heal us. We can trust that if we must feel pain, it is a part of healing, and it is good. We can become willing to surrender to and accept the inevitable painful feelings that are a good part of recovery.</p> <p>Go with the flow, even when the flow takes us through uncomfortable feelings. Release, freedom, healing, and good feelings are on the other side.</p> <p>Today, I am open and willing to feel what I need to feel. I am willing to stop my compulsive behaviors. I am willing to let go of my denial. I am willing to feel what I need to feel to be healed, healthy and whole.</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/","title":"Teaching Notes","text":""},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/#teacher-intro","title":"Teacher Intro","text":"<p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/#class-intro","title":"Class Intro","text":"<p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/#head-what-why","title":"Head (What &amp; Why)","text":"<p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/#hand-motivation","title":"Hand (Motivation)","text":"<p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/Teaching%20Notes/#heart-tools","title":"Heart (Tools)","text":"<p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p> <p>$~$</p>"},{"location":"C3-Feelings/WhatGeneratesFeelings/","title":"What Generates Feelings?","text":"<p>Besides the fact that we now carry feelings induced in us during childhood, the fact that  our emotions are generated from our thoughts also influences our damaged and exaggerated feeling reality. This process of generating feelings from the way we interpret the events around us automatically leads to trouble for codependents, because the experience of being abused damages our thinking. The process of assigning meaning to the events in our lives is skewed and the conclusions we draw are often inaccurate - but we don't know it. We believe our thinking is fine. But in fact our emotional responses to other people's actions toward us often seem bizarre to them.</p> <p>In the process of generating feelings, we first bring some data into our innter world with one of our five senses... We draw conclusions, and interpretations and give meaning to what we heard, saw, tasted, smelled, or felt.  </p> <p>Out of this thinking comes our emotions about our thoughts. As a result of our emotions, we choose a behavior...</p> <p>We cannot change our emotions. What we feel is what we feel. In fact it is dysfunctional to try not to be angry or not to be afraid when that is what we feel. To deal with an emotion we must acknowledge that we feel it and learn to express it appropriately. But we can examine the thinking we are doing that leads to the emotion.</p> <p>We can often choose a different behavior after we've had our feelings. Examining the thinking is far more effective in reducing the intensity of emotions we feel than changing our behavior... We must also try to express our emptions with healthy, nonabusive behaviors no matter what is triggering them.</p> <p>What I seldom realize as a codependent is that because of my childhood abuse I tend to put a negative interpretation on incoming data when a positive interpretation might be far more accurate.</p> <p>I \"transform\" incoming data as it goes through the grid of my abused past. I take the perception into my mind and give it meaning very different from what a functional person would give it. For example, when someone gives me a genuine complement, because of my past abuse I can transform it into a subtle insult by labeling the remark as sarcasm. To make matters worse, I have no idea that I just did that; I think my brain is working perfectly well. I think it was sarcasm until the evidence is overwhelming that it was not.</p> <p>Add to the fact that out of this feeling reality based on skewed thinking we then act, it's easy to see how we codependents are automatically set up for trouble and also don't understand why we're in trouble. We think we're acting  quite normally. Consequently a relationship we have with a more functional person can be chaotic for that person as well as for us.

Boundary systems have two parts: external and internal</p> <p>Our external boundary allows us to choose our distance from other people and enables us to give or refuse permission for them to touch us. Our external boundary also keeps our bodies from offending someone else's body. The external boundary is divided into two parts: physical and sexual. The physical part of our external boundary controls how close we let people come to us and whether they can touch us or not. Also, if we have intact external boundaries, we know to ask permisssion to touch other people and we are careful not to stand too close to them for their comfort. In a similar way, our sexual boundary controls sexual distanct and touch</p> <p>Our internal boundary protects our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keeps them functional. When we are using our internal boundary, we can take responsibility for our thinking, feelings, and behavior and keep them separate from that of others, and stop blaming them for what we think, feel and do. Our internal boundary also allows us to stop taking responsibility for the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of others, allowing us to stop manipulating and controlling those around us.</p>"},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/Class5-Handout/","title":"Wants and Needs (Self Care)","text":""},{"location":"C5-SelfCare/Class5-Handout/#what-are-they","title":"What are they?","text":"<p>From Facing Codependence by Pia Mellody, Andrea Miller, &amp; J.

An adult is responsible for knowing how to address each need and asking for help when help is truly needed.</p> <p>The dependency needs for adults are food, shelter, clothing, medical/dental attention, physical nurturing, emotional nurturing (time, attention, and direction from others), sex, and financial resources (earning, saving, spending, budgeting and investing money).</p> <p>There are some needs that can only be met through interaction with another person, such as physical nurturing or emotional nurturing.

Codependents seem to have the most difficulty experiencing feelings moderately; they feel little or no emotions or have explosive or agonizing ones. There are four different kinds of feeling reality that codependents experience. And until one can recognize these four kinds of feelings and where they come from, life can be very baffling and confusing for a codependent. 1. Adult Feeling Reality - Adult feeling reality is a mature authentic emotional response to your thinking. It is not dysfunctional or codependent. These feelings are usually moderate when you experience them and cause you to feel centered within yourself. 2. Adult-Induced Feeling Reality - In functinoal people, adult-induced feelings are the result of a process called empathy. As a healthy adult, you can be empathetic with someone else as that person shares his or her feelings because you can experience that person's feelings with him or her a little bit. 3. Frozen Feelings From Childhood - One way this occurs is that the feelings elicited in a child during abuse are so overwhelming and miserable that the child shuts down or \"freezes\" the feelings in order to survive. Another way this might happen is that the child may be attacked physically, verbally, or both for having or showing feelings. The feelings involved are usually anger, pain, or fear. 4. Adult-to-Child Carried Feelings - Children also absorb feelings such as shame, rage, fear, and pain from the adult who is abusing them.

Healthy people know that they are valuable  and precious even when they make a mistake, are confronted by an angry person, are cheated or lied to, or are rejected by a lover, friend, parent, child, or boss. Healthy individuals may feel other emotions, such as guilt,  fear, anger, and pain in these circumstances, but the sense of self-esteem remains intact.</p> <p>Codependents experience difficulty with self-esteem at one or both extremes. At one extreme self-esteem is low or nonexistent: you think that you are worth less than others. At the opposite extreme is arrogance and grandiosity: you think you are set apart and superior to other people.</p> <ul> <li>Low self-esteem comes from dysfunctional caregivers giving their children verbal or nonverbal messages that they are \"less-than\" people. These messages from the caregivers become part of the children's own opinion of themselves. Upon reaching adulthood, it is almost impossible for those raised with \"less-than\" messages to be able to generate the feeling from within that they have value.</li> <li>Arrogant and grandiose behavior arises out of one of two distinct situations.

Such children are treated by the family as if they can do no wrong.</li> </ul> <p>If codependents have any kind of esteem, it is not self-esteem but other-esteem. This is based on external things such as how they look, how much money they make, why they know, what kind of car they drive, what kind of job they have, how well their children perform, how powerful and important or attractive their spouse is, the degrees they have earned, and how well they perform at activities in which others value excellence. Other-esteem is based on either one's \"human doing\" or in the opinions and behavior of other people.

It is when someone is on our side, is for us instead of against us, and is showing favor towards us that is unmerited. In other words, there is nothing that you do to gain it. It is given freely.</p> <p>In terms of God, it has to do with his relational character, that He is a God of love. He desires relationship with us, and He gives it freely to us. He desires to connect and be with us, and because of His grace, he desires to give to us and to help us. When we are growing, it is because God is bestowing some gift of grace to us in some various form and that gift is something that is unearned.</p> <p>It may be the gift of love shown in salvation and forgiveness. Or it may be the gift of a talent that he has bestowed on you. It may be an opportunity to take a class or to have an experience, or it may be the love of a person. Gods gifts of Grace come in many forms to us, through direct intervention by Him, or through His use of people in our lives. As Peter tells us, when we are receiving love and help from other people, that is the grace of God being given to us. (1 Peter 4:10)</p> <p>Whatever the form of grace that you have or need in your process, the essence of grace must be present; unmerited favor. What that means is that you need people and support in your growth process who are for you and not against you. You need some people and God on your side no matter how you are doing. That is the unmerited part of grace.</p> <p>When you are growing, and getting help depends on your performance, that is a Catch-22. You have to have help to get better, and if you have to get better to get the help, you don't have a chance.</p> <p>So, in evaluating your system of growth, you may ask yourself the question am I getting help and support that is going to be there regardless of how I am doing? Help that, I do not have to earn? This is getting the nutrients that we need in order to grow from outside of ourselves, from God and His people. There are many aspects of this help described in the Bible, too many to name here. But here is a short list of some of the more basic ways that we experience grace in the growth process.</p> <p>Unconditional acceptance and forgiveness from God and other people. (1John 1:9, James 5:16)</p> <p>Support and encouragement when we are too weak to make it on our own. (1 Thess 5:11, 14, Ecc 4: 9-11, Heb 10:25)</p> <p>Modeling and imparting skills in living, from others, (Heb 13:7)</p> <p>Correction and instruction. (Lev 19:17)</p> <p>There are many forms of Gods grace that people possess to give to you through their gifts. If you are going to be growing, you must make sure that these elements of grace are present in your system of growth for change to take place. You must be in some place of unmerited favor for growth to happen. You must find a place of unconditional love and acceptance, </p>"},{"location":"C8-GraceTruthTime/GraceTruthTime/","title":"Grace, Truth &amp; Time","text":""},{"location":"C8-GraceTruthTime/GraceTruthTime/#what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-important","title":"What are they and why are they so important?","text":"<p>The three ingredients of growth! When they all come together we can for the first time have the true self loved and accepted and grow in the likeness of God.</p> <p>Grace is the first ingredient. There's no way to earn it or deserve it, anymore than you can deserve the taste of raspberries and cream, or earn good looks or bring about your own birth.</p> <p>Grace is the unmerited favor of God, toward people. To put it another way, Grace is unconditional love and acceptance. Such love is the foundation upon which all healing of the human spirit rests. God loves us freely, without condition. It says that you are accepted just like you are and that you will not be shamed or incur wrath for whatever you are experiencing.</p> <p>Truth is the second ingredient necessary for growing up. Truth is what is real, it describes how things really are. Just as Grace is the relational aspect of God's character. Truth is the structural aspect of His character, the skeleton life hangs on.</p> <p>Truth implies many things, but in relationships it implies honesty, being real with one another, and living out the truth of God. Many people think that safe relationships are relationships that just give grace without confrontation, but ultimately these relationships can be destructive as well.</p> <p>We need safe people in our life that will be honest with us, telling us where we are wrong and where we need to change.</p> <p>Time is the third ingredient. The Bible tells us that in order for grace and truth to produce fruit we need a third element, time. Time joined by Grace and Truth.</p> <p>Time is not just an act of God's grace to us, \"giving us some space.\" He is much too loving to allow us to continue in sin for one minute longer than necessary. Time is not a luxury but a necessity.</p> <p>We will also learn about good and bad time and how all the ingredients work together. Helping us grow into Healthy Mature Adults and how to extend these things to ourselves and others.

When the true self comes into grace, and truth giving relationships, that self can develop over time.</p> <p>Some people remember the specific time they decided to leave good time</p> <p>Others cannot specifically remember making a decision, but nevertheless, as a result of pain and injury, they were forced underground. They were pushed outside of time, and into a place where they could not experience certain years or own their true self. When an aspect of a person does not enter into time, this persons emotional maturity will stagnate at this level and or age.</p> <p>Stagnation is seen often in people who abuse substances such as drugs and alcohol.

If we hide, time is bad time, for it is not being redemptive.</p> <p>It is literally never too late to open up to those who love us and care about our development. Because the aspect of ourselves that goes outside of time in childhood gets stored in its chronological state, it is still that same age when it returns.</p> <p>God can use our current relationships to provide the nurturing we didn't receive as children, the mentoring we missed as school-age kids, or the companionship we needed as teenagers. God has promised that he will take care of us.</p> <p>Because time is experience, we can influence any \"past\" aspect of ourselves in the present, In the present we can reach the hurting , lonely child of our past.
